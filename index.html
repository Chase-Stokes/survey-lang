      <p>An explosion wakes you from your sleep. The smell of smoke and the screams of your fellow villages fill the air. The wood creaks as you run to grab a weapon to prepare for the battle. You open your closet and three weapons lie before you. Which weapon do you choose?</p>

Filled with rage at the sight of the village you love in flames, you rush to save the child. As you approach, the goblin turns his attention towards you, but it was to late. You smash your sheild into him, knocking him to the ground. Plunging your sword through his neck before he could get back to his feet. You tell the child to run inside and find a safe place to hide.

Filled with rage at the sight of the villagers you love in flames, you feel power welling inside of you. You channel that feeling into your staff, and release a ball of fire towards the goblin. The fireball grows in size as it flies towards your enemy, and upon crashing into its target steam fills the area where it once stood. You tell the child to run inside and find a safe place to hide.

The smoke gets thicker the closer you get, with it getting harder and harder to breathe with each step you take. An arrow flies past your head as you reach them. A group of goblin archers take aim to fire another volley. You rush in as they fire blocking some of the arrows with your shield while dodging the others. You slice and stab your way through them, parrying any attack they make.  Before you get the chance to rejoice in the victory, you see the orc commander approaching carrying the mangled body of the elder. How do you attack?</p>

When you get inside, you realize you were to late... You see an orc pulling his blace from the elders chest. How do you attack?</p>
