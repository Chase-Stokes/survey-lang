      <p>An explosion wakes you from your sleep. The smell of smoke and the screams of your fellow villages fill the air. The wood creaks as you run to grab a weapon to prepare for the battle. You open your closet and three weapons lie before you. Which weapon do you choose?</p>

      <p>You leave your house. As you step out you see a goblin running towards your neighbors child.<span class="insertName"></span>, HELP ME! they yell. Filled with rage at the sight of the village you love in flames, you rush to save the child. As you approach, the goblin turns his attention towards you, but it was to late. You smash your sheild into him, knocking him to the ground. Plunging your sword through his neck before he could get back to his feet. You tell the child to run inside and find a safe place to hide. What do you do next?</p>

      <p>You leave your house. As you step out you see a goblin running towards your neighbors child.<span class="insertName"></span>, HELP ME!, they yell. Filled with rage at the sight of the village you love in flames, you feel power welling inside of you. You channel that feeling into your staff, and release a ball of fire towards the goblin. The fireball grows in size as it flies towards your enemy, and upon crashing into its target steam fills the area where it once stood. You tell the child to run inside and find a safe place to hide.
